I have been working as a QA for past 7 years. In those years I worked in E-commerce, banking, gaming and insurance domains. As an automation engineer I have worked in various technologies and automation tools like Java, C#, Selenium, QTP , Sikuli, Appium and currently obsessing over playwright. In addition to these tools I have also worked with Specflow, cucumber, Testng. Coming to my soft skills I am an effective communicator with excellent relationship building and interpersonal skills. Motivated with a “GET IT DONE” attitude.
